Started the project, acquired the resources for it, and made the basic HTML. Started on some CSS stuff and thats all thats really left to do with this. *not bad* if I may say so myself. Positioning is something worth getting used to, along with getting everything to be proper sizes when the browser size is changed. This is definitely a good start though.

Continuing with the CSS styling. Finished the left side, and styled the right-side paragraphs + the form. Almost done with this one! Should be done with this by the end of my next study session. Then it's on to the rest of the intermediate HTML/CSS curriculum.
